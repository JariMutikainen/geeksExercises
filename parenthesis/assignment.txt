Given an expression string exp, examine whether the pairs and the orders of 
“{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in exp.
For example, the program should print 'balanced' for exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}” 
and 'not balanced' for exp = “[(])”



Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consist of a string of expression, in a separate line.

Output:

Print 'balanced' without quotes if pair of parenthesis are balanced else print 
'not balanced' in a separate line.


Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100


Example:

Input:
3
{([])}
()
()[]

Output:
balanced
balanced
balanced
