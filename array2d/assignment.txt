Determine the row index with minimum number of ones. The given 2D matrix has 
only zeroes and ones and also the matrix is sorted row wise . If two or more 
rows have same number of 1's than print the row with smallest index.

Note: If there is no '1' in any of the row than print '-1'.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test 
cases. The first line of each test case consists of two integer n and m. The 
next line consists of n*m spaced integers. 

Output:
Print the index of the row with minimum number of 1's.

Constraints: 
1<=T<=200
1<=n,m<=100

Example:
Input:
2
3 3
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
4 4
0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1

Output:
-1
0
